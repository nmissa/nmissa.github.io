I recently joined (May 2021) an exciting startup, Emcode Photonics, to work on different optical solutions.
Previously I worked as an Optical Systems Design Engineer at ADI, in the Molecular Sensing Group since August 2019. Before that, I was a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in the ECE and Bioengineering departments at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I finished my Doctor of Philosophy degree from Washington University in St. Louis in the fall of 2017.
